# To do
- Create tests for what's already implemented
- Add keywords `bit7` & `bit6`?. See [ref](##2022-8-5)
- Add `>` and `<` operators for getting the high and low bytes of a label reference, 
	respectively, as an immediate value
- Integrate with Cpu6502 and make automated VM tests

# Misc
- Transforming names `.toLowerCase()` should be done ASAP, in the visit function that
	gets the name from the parser. This way, anywhere else we know the name is
	unique by means of ensured lowercase.

- Tipos de Statements:  

* Con addressing:  
	- Aritméticos: ADC, SBC, INC, DEC, INX, DEX, INY, DEY
	- Lógicos: AND, EOR, ORA, BIT, CMP
	- Shifting: ASL, LSR, ROR, ROL
	- Asignación: LDA, STA, LDX, STX

* Sin addressing:
	- Stack: TSX, TXS, PHP, PHA, PLP, PLA
	- Branches: BMI, BPL, BEQ, BNE, BVS, BVC, BCC, BCS
	- Misc: SEC, CLC, SED, CLD, SEI, CLI, CLV, NOP, NOP3, BRK

* Saltos: JMP, JSR, RTS, RTI

# Log:

## 2024-09-15
Removed Dart code because it was all already implemented in Typescript.

## 2024-03-29
Se me fue de mambo el proyecto en complejidad. Tengo que volver a una clase sola.

## 2024-03-14
Added forward reference info in the labels Hash, but there can be many forward references to the same label, so we have to record them separately.

## 2024-01-30
Al pedo el SymbolPass porque también se pueden definir labels con forward references, además para saber la dirección de un label: hay que parsear todo el código :'(
Mejor volver a la idea original, hacer una sola pasada, dejar el espacio y luego cuando se define la forward reference ir y completarlo.

## 2023-08-31
We have a problem. Assembler distinguishes immediate values from addresses with the # sign.
We don't want that verbosity in FASS, that's why names are treated equally, when possible, whether they are a constant or a label.
So, instead of having both constants and direct label addressing defined as IDENFTIFIER, they'll be both integrated into a single rule called `name`, to prevent ambiguity for Antlr.
Then we determine if the name refers to a constant or a label.

We also need to implement a way to use the individual bytes of a label's address as literals, like assembler does with < and >.

## 2022-10-31
Implemented goto (JMP)

## 2022-10-22

I implemented an `if else` fully functional, even nestable. Great achievement!

## 2022-10-1

Well, I forked a try to use visitors and the Dart language, let's see how this goes.
Update: both seem like a very good idea.

## 2022-8-20

Started implementing automated tests.
Removed the grammar that was unimplemented, now I will add it as I go.

## 2022-8-15

Just found out `const` is failing and don't know when it started failing.
Should add unit tests for regression testing, so by running all tests on every commit I can spot regression errors easily.

## 2022-8-5

Should add the keywords `bit7` & `bit6`.
In assembly you would check for these bits using `BVC`, `BVS`, `BPL` & `BMI`, most likely after `BIT` & `CMP`.
To explicitly state that you aren't really checking for sign or overflow as the mnemonics suggest, you would use `if bit7 = 1`, etc.
That way you explicitly state that you are checking for arbitrary bits.
Of course the rest of the bits (0..5) don't have a corresponding CPU flag, so they must be tested with a more classical approach.

## 2022-4-6

const and data are implemented, although some value types are not implemented yet.  
Will implement all value types as they come up in tests or use cases.
